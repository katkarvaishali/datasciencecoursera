Coursera Assignment - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This course project is for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Project.  

Overview :
This project is to demonstrate to get and clean data of a tidy data set that can be used for analysis

I]  The R Script run_analysis.R does the following:
1.  Get the data
2.  Unzip the data file
3.  Unzipped files are in the folder UCI HAR Dataset. Get the list of the files from that folder.
4.  Load required packages as below 
- dplyr
- data.table
- tidyr
5.  Load below mentioned files keeping only those columns to reflect a mean or standard deviation for each measurement
- UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
6.  Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
7.  Merge the two datasets
8.  Convert the  activity  and  subject  columns into factors
9.  Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

II]  The end result is shown in the file  tidy.txt .
